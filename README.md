hackAIR is an open technology platform that you can use to access, collect and improve air quality information in Europe.

This repository contains code and resources for the hackAIR mobile sensor, a Bluetooth-enabled air quality sensor based on PSoC. 

Visit the [repository wiki](https://github.com/hackair-project/hackAIR-PSoC/wiki) for the full documentation, and go to [hackAIR.eu](http://www.hackair.eu/hackair-mobile/) for a more user-friendly tutorial.

hackAIR also has designs for an Arduino or Wemos based hackAIR home air quality sensor, and combines other sources of air quality information for a full map.
