hackAIR is an open technology platform that you can use to access, collect and improve air quality information in Europe.

This repository contains code and resources for the hackAIR mobile sensor, a Bluetooth-enabled air quality sensor based on PSoC.

hackAIR also has designs for an Arduino based hackAIR home air quality sensor, and combines other sources of air quality information for a full map.
